# Sarang Ravi Chouguley — CV Site

A minimal, responsive CV website suitable for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `sarang-cv` (or any name).
2. Upload the contents of this folder (at minimum: `index.html` and `styles.css`, plus `assets/CV.pdf`).
3. In the repository **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**, and pick the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
4. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Local preview
Just open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.
